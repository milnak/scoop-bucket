::  ---------------------------------------  ::


Version 2.8.4.185 (Release date: 2020-10-15)

 - Fixed: Encoding a .wav file to FLAC format will fail with the
          error message 'file is not a supported type of audio
          file or is corrupt' if the file is in WAVE/RF64 instead
          of WAVE/RIFF format.
 - Reworked: Process log error message on the 'Encode wav files',
             'Re-encode flac files' and 'Decode audio files' pages
             when the 'Delete source files' option is checked and
             deletion of a source file failed.
 - Updated: 'About' dialog.
 - Updated: Manifest file.
 - Updated: License file shown during installation.
 - Minor tweaks.


Version 2.8.3.182 (Release date: 2019-11-04)

 - Fixed: Sometimes Trader's Little Helper will hang when checking
          audio files for sector boundary errors. Any attempts to
          cancel processing or to exit the application will fail.
          Note: This bug was introduced with TLH v2.8.2 and is
          therefore not present in releases prior to v2.8.2.
 - Updated: Manifest file.
 - Updated: License file shown during installation.


Version 2.8.2.181 (Release date: 2019-04-03)

 - Fixed: Checking certain non-compliant .wav files for sector
          boundary errors will fail with an error message box
          saying 'List index out of bounds'. After closing the
          pop up Trader's Little Helper hangs. Though the GUI is
          still responsive any attempts to cancel processing or
          to exit the application will fail.
 - Fixed: Checking .ape, .flac or .shn files for sector boundary
          errors will fail with an error message box saying 'List
          index out of bounds' if the file name starts with a dash
          ('-'). After closing the pop up Trader's Little Helper
          hangs. Though the GUI is still responsive any attempts
          to cancel processing or to exit the application will
          fail.
 - Reworked: Procedure for reading the output of the command-line
             executable used for checking files for sector boundary
             errors.

 - Fixed: Processing a .flac file will fail with an error message
          ('file does not appear to be a flac file' or 'file is not
          a supported type of audio file or is corrupt') if the file
          contains an ID3v2 tag at its beginning. Note: This bug was
          introduced with TLH v2.8.0 and is therefore not present in
          releases prior to v2.8.0.

            'Integrate Trader's Little Helper into Windows Explorer context
            menus'.
 - Changed: The 'Integrate Trader's Little Helper into Windows Explorer'
            option on the 'Select Additional Tasks' page of the installer has

            checksum file' page, only files with file extensions appropriate
            to the type of checksum file selected will be displayed and
            processed. The files not displayed (if any) are being hold in
            the background. So if the type of the checksum file to create
            is changed, again all files added can be taken into account to
            create and display the list of appropriate files.
 - Fixed: When encoding .wav files to flac format with 'Post encoding tasks'
          option 'Test encoded files' checked the test result always will

          occured.' if an error was detected by metaflac.
 - Fixed: When creating a .st5 checksum file, the process log summary says 'No errors
          occured.' if an error was detected by shntool.

          if shntool can't provide any SBE related information about the audio data.
 - Fixed: When using Windows font size settings greater than 96 DPI (large fonts)
          the GUI is incompletely displayed so all the right-sided buttons are not
          accessible.

            of 'shntool.exe' and 'shorten.exe' are native Windows compiles now.
 - Changed: GUI's tab structure has been transformed into a menu structure.
 - Changed: Percentage progress indicators instead of dots in the process logs
            of most of the pages.

            names ('track1-fixed.flac' or 'track5-postpadded', for example)
            that need to be re-named ('track1.wav' will be directly encoded to
            'track1.flac', for example).
 - Changed: The page 'Test encoded audio files' has been integrated into the page
            'Decode audio files' (as option 'Test without writing decoded files').
 - Changed: Verifying .ffp files will always work the way it does in older
            releases when using the 'full ffp verify' setting. The option to
            de-activate this setting has been removed from the 'Preferences' dialog.
 - Changed: Interfaces of the 'Encode wav files', 'Create torrent file' and 'Fix
            sector boundary errors' pages.

            error occurs but will be continued processing the next files.
 - Changed: The 'Preview w/o making changes' option on the 'Fix sector boundary
            errors' page had to be removed because the latest releases of
            'shntool.exe' don't offer that option anymore.
 - Changed: At the end of the setup procedure the changelog is not shown anymore.
 - Fixed: Trader's Little Helper might hang if files are encoded with the 'Align
          on sector boundaries' option enabled and there is no more disk space to
          store all encoded data.
 - Fixed: If there is no more disk space when encoding to flac format the error
          message in question is confusing / not meaningful.
 - Fixed: Verification of a checksum file fails if the files listed in the checksum
          file do not have a common root folder.
 - Fixed: Files can be added multiple times via the 'Add files' dialog of the 'Create
          checksum file' page.

          the file order confirmation box always pops up no matter what is/was set in
          the 'Preferences' dialog.
 - Fixed: When using the context menu of a file in Windows Explorer to add that file
          to an already running instance of Trader's Little Helper sometimes a 'cannot
          focus a disabled or invisible window' error occurs.
 - Updated: 'Action to perform' dialog that will be opened when shell integration or
             Drag & Drop is used to pass a folder or files to Trader's Little Helper.

Version 1.1.1.90 (Release date: 2006-10-30)
 - Fixed: Drag & Drop with files that are not .cfp, .ffp, .md5, .st5, .ape, .flac,
          .shn, or .wav files will fail with an error message.
 - Fixed: Encoding .wav files to flac format with option 'Align on sector boundaries'
          checked will work properly, but the subsequent rename of the tempory .flac
          files to their final names will fail and further operations will be aborted,
          if the string '.flac' can be found in the path name of the .wav files
          ('E:\Bob Dylan\bd1988-06-18.flac16\track01.wav' for example).
 - Fixed: Encoding .wav files with sub-chunk headers to flac format with option 'Align
          on sector boundaries' unchecked will stop with an error message, and further
          processing will be aborted.

            default setting.
 - Changed: For testing and decoding .shn files 'shntool.exe' is used instead of
            'shorten.exe' because in some cases 'shorten.exe' does not detect zero
            blocks in shn encoded audio data and so does not report any error.
 - Fixed: Checksums are compared with case-sensitivity when verifying checksum files.
 - Fixed: In some rare cases the default directory to add files from is the installation
          directory of Trader's Little Helper.
 - Fixed: If the 'Search' dialog of Windows Explorer is used to pass files to create
          a checksum file the determining the common root folder will fail in most
          cases.
 - Fixed: If an error occured when decoding .flac files sometimes the file name is
          shown twice and/or there is more than one error message line in the process
          log window.
 - Fixed: Shell integration of Trader's Little Helper is done in every folder, even
          in ones where is doesn't make any sense ('My Computer', for example).
